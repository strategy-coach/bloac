# **Business Lifecycles and Operations as Code (BLOaC)**

The **Business Lifecycles and Operations as Code (BLOaC)** framework represents a transformative approach to managing and optimizing business processes in SaaS organizations and beyond. By leveraging the principles of GitOps and applying them to business lifecycles, BLOaC enables transparency, automation, scalability, and collaboration across teams and functions.

Using tools like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket as the foundation, BLOaC treats business workflows—such as marketing, sales, customer success, and support—as structured, version-controlled assets stored in repositories. These workflows can be integrated with analytics, automated via CI/CD pipelines, and extended with user-friendly overlays to ensure accessibility for non-technical users.

This white paper explores the BLOaC framework, detailing its applications across various business lifecycles, the challenges it addresses, and the tools and strategies that make it practical and impactful.

## The Principles of BLOaC

BLOaC is built on foundational principles that align with modern GitOps practices:

- **Transparency**: Every action and decision is logged and version-controlled, ensuring traceability and accountability.
- **Collaboration**: Teams work in shared repositories, fostering real-time collaboration and visibility.
- **Automation**: CI/CD pipelines automate routine tasks like report generation, data synchronization, and lifecycle transitions.
- **Scalability**: Repositories can grow with the organization, accommodating increasingly complex workflows.
- **Extensibility**: BLOaC integrates with analytics tools, Web UIs, and BI platforms to support diverse business needs.

## Business Lifecycles in BLOaC

BLOaC organizes business processes into distinct lifecycles, each representing a functional area. These lifecycles can be implemented in repositories with structured content (e.g., Markdown files with frontmatter), tracked via issues, and automated with CI/CD pipelines.

- Marketing Lifecycles. The marketing lifecycle encompasses activities to attract, nurture, and convert leads. BLOaC structures this lifecycle into repositories with campaigns, content, and performance analytics.
- Sales Lifecycles (["CRM as Code"](./sales.md)). The sales lifecycle tracks the journey of leads through qualification, proposal, negotiation, and closing. BLOaC enables granular tracking of deals and automates follow-ups and reporting.
- Customer Success Lifecycles. Onboarding, engagement, renewals, and upselling are managed through BLOaC. Customer health metrics and lifecycle stages are stored as structured data, with automated alerts for at-risk accounts.
- Customer Support Lifecycles. Support tickets, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides are managed in repositories, with issues tracking resolution status. Automation ensures timely responses and reporting.
- Professional Services Lifecycles. Custom solutions, consulting projects, and deliverables are tracked as issues and stored in repositories. BLOaC provides a structured approach to managing milestones and collaboration.
- Additional Lifecycles. BLOaC extends to many other lifecycles, including finance and billing, compliance, legal, partner management, training, data governance, risk management, and more. Each lifecycle is treated as a code-based workflow, ensuring uniformity and traceability.

## Ease of Use Overlays

While BLOaC relies on GitOps infrastructure, it recognizes the challenges non-technical staff face in using repositories, Markdown files, and Git workflows. To address this, BLOaC integrates **user-friendly overlays**:

- Web UIs abstract the complexity of repositories, offering forms, dashboards, and WYSIWYG editors.  
- Task management tools like ZenHub or Linear sync with GitHub Issues for intuitive task tracking.  
- Automated workflows handle backend processes, ensuring non-technical users can focus on their tasks.  

This approach maintains the flexibility and scalability of BLOaC while ensuring usability for all team members.

## Unified Role Visibility: ICs and MPs

BLOaC enables transparent role identification for **Individual Contributors (ICs)** and **Management Personnel (MPs)**. ICs create intellectual property (e.g., writing Markdown files or coding features), while MPs provide oversight through pull requests, reviews, and approvals.

PLM systems like GitHub make it easy to distinguish between these roles, offering:

- Granular visibility into contributions.  
- Accountability for ICs and MPs.  
- Equitable recognition for contributions.  
- Fraud detection through activity analysis.  

By leveraging PLM systems, BLOaC ensures a clear understanding of who is creating and who is guiding, enabling advanced analytics and compliance.

### Analytics and Querying with BLOaC

A common challenge in BLOaC is aggregating and analyzing data spread across Markdown files, Issues, and repository metadata. Tools like `surveilr` address this by ingesting content into a **uniform SQL schema**, enabling powerful querying and analytics.

[`surveilr`](https://www.surveilr.com) synchronizes data from Git repositories into SQL databases, supporting:

- Cross-repository analytics.  
- Automated dashboards and reports.  
- Compliance and Anomaly analysis. 

This integration bridges the gap between unstructured Git content and structured data systems, unlocking insights while preserving the flexibility of BLOaC.

## Extending BLOaC Beyond Core Lifecycles

BLOaC is not limited to marketing, sales, and customer success. It can be extended to manage:

- Compliance and Security Operations  
- Training and Enablement Programs  
- Partner Ecosystems  
- Incident Response and Crisis Management  
- Strategic Planning and Innovation  

Each lifecycle is treated as code, with repositories storing tasks, policies, and workflows, and CI/CD pipelines automating key processes.

## Challenges and Solutions in BLOaC

**Challenge**: Non-technical users may struggle with GitOps infrastructure.  
**Solution**: Overlay Web UIs and task management tools for usability.  

**Challenge**: Analytics and querying across repositories can be difficult.  
**Solution**: Use tools like `surveilr` to aggregate content into SQL databases.  

**Challenge**: Scaling to complex, multi-lifecycle workflows.  
**Solution**: Maintain modular repositories with shared infrastructure and cross-lifecycle integration.
