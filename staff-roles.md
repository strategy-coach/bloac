# Staff Roles ICs and MPs

One of the most transformative aspects of the **Business Lifecycles as Code (BLOaC)** framework is its ability to provide **granular visibility into individual and team contributions** through modern Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems like GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket. These systems naturally facilitate a structured and auditable workflow where **Individual Contributors (ICs)** and **Management Personnel (MPs)** are clearly identified and their contributions are easily tracked.

**Individual Contributors (ICs)** - ICs are the personnel actively performing the work to **create intellectual property (IP)**, such as:
- Writing Markdown documents.
- Coding features or fixing bugs.
- Submitting deliverables in repositories.

**Management Personnel (MPs)** - MPs provide **leadership, guidance, and oversight**, such as:
- Reviewing pull requests.
- Approving designs or documents.
- Ensuring ICs adhere to quality and compliance standards.

## How Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Systems like GitHub Enable Transparency

Modern PLM systems have built-in features that **track contributions at a highly granular level**. Here's how:

### **1. Revision Control**:
- Every commit in a Git-based system is attributed to an individual, creating an immutable history of who performed what work, when, and how.
- ICs can be identified by their commit activity, ensuring full accountability for IP creation.

### **2. Pull Requests (PRs)**:
- PRs serve as a mechanism for MPs to review, guide, and approve work before it is merged into the main repository.
- The **approval history** on PRs creates a record of leadership involvement, ensuring oversight responsibilities are tracked.

### **3. Issues and Task Tracking**:
- Each GitHub Issue or GitLab task is assigned to a specific IC or MP, making it clear who is responsible for execution versus oversight.

### **4. Audit Trails**:
- Comprehensive logs of all activities (commits, PR approvals, comments, etc.) ensure **end-to-end traceability**.

## Benefits of IC / MP Role Identification in BLOaC

1. **Granular Visibility**:
   - Understand precisely **which ICs are creating IP** and **which MPs are providing guidance or oversight**.
   - Distinguish between operational and strategic roles in the lifecycle.

2. **Accountability**:
   - Clear assignment of responsibility ensures that all contributors are held accountable for their actions.
   - MPs' involvement in quality control and decision-making is fully documented.

3. **Equitable Recognition**:
   - Provides a basis for recognizing and rewarding individual and team contributions fairly.
   - Helps differentiate high-performing ICs and MPs.

4. **Fraud Detection**:
   - Enables **forensic-level analysis** of contributions and approvals to detect anomalies or fraudulent activity.
   - For example, unusual patterns of PR approvals by MPs or backdated commits can be flagged.

5. **Compliance and IP Ownership**:
   - Establishes a legally defensible record of who created specific pieces of intellectual property.
   - Ensures compliance with governance standards in regulated industries.

### Analytics and Anomaly Detection with ICs and MPs

The granular data provided by PLM systems can be used to **craft analytics and fraud detection solutions**:

#### **1. Contribution Analysis**:
- Use data from commits, Issues, and PRs to measure IC productivity:
  - Number of commits.
  - Size and impact of changes.
  - Frequency of contributions.
- Analyze MPs' oversight based on the volume and quality of PR reviews and approvals.

#### **2. Role Categorization**:
- Build **custom reports** to categorize contributions:
  - Distinguish between IC-generated commits and MP-reviewed approvals.
  - Measure the impact of MPs' guidance on project outcomes.

#### **3. Anomaly Detection**:
- Identify **suspicious patterns**:
  - MPs approving PRs without proper reviews.
  - ICs making unauthorized changes to sensitive files.
  - Gaps in MP oversight during critical lifecycle stages.

#### **4. Fraud Detection**:
- Correlate contribution data with other systems (e.g., HR, payroll) to detect fraud, such as:
  - Misrepresentation of work completed.
  - Ghost contributors or fake approvals.
  - Unauthorized changes to IP ownership.

#### **5. Automated Alerts**:
- Leverage tools like GitHub Actions or custom scripts to monitor for:
  - PRs merged without MP approval.
  - Anomalies in commit frequency or size.
  - ICs or MPs bypassing established workflows.

## **Real-World Application**

### **Scenario: Sales Playbook Lifecycle**
- **ICs**:
  - Create playbook content in Markdown and submit commits.
  - Draft lead management workflows stored in repositories.
- **MPs**:
  - Review and approve updates via PRs.
  - Ensure that playbook changes align with strategic goals.

### **Workflow in PLM**:
1. **IC Submission**:
   - IC commits a new sales workflow to the `sales-playbook` repository.
   - Commit metadata records their identity and timestamp.

2. **MP Review**:
   - MP reviews the commit in a PR and provides comments or approvals.
   - PR metadata logs the review date and the MP’s identity.

3. **Tracking and Auditing**:
   - All activities are stored in the PLM system for future analysis.

### **Outcome**:
- ICs’ and MPs’ contributions are clearly delineated, allowing leadership to evaluate their respective impacts on lifecycle progress.

## BLOaC as a Foundation for PLM-Driven Analytics

### **Why It Works**
BLOaC integrates seamlessly with PLM systems, providing the **perfect foundation for lifecycle analytics**. By tracking IC and MP roles transparently, organizations can:

- **Scale Operations**: Efficiently manage complex, multi-repository workflows.
- **Improve Oversight**: Ensure consistent quality control through documented MP involvement.
- **Enhance Reporting**: Generate detailed reports for management, stakeholders, and auditors.

### **Extending PLM Visibility**
With modern tools and workflows, PLM systems allow organizations to go beyond lifecycle tracking:
- **Cross-Lifecycle Insights**: Analyze contributions across marketing, sales, support, and other lifecycles.
- **Unified Reporting**: Combine IC and MP activity data for integrated dashboards.
- **Streamlined Governance**: Build custom rules and alerts to ensure adherence to internal policies.

## Learn More

By leveraging PLM systems like GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket, **BLOaC** makes it easier than ever to identify the roles and responsibilities of **Individual Contributors (ICs)** and **Management Personnel (MPs)**. This transparency ensures:

- **Granular visibility** into lifecycle activities.
- **Accurate tracking of IP creation and oversight**.
- **Simplified analytics and fraud detection**, enabling businesses to build trust and accountability into their operations.

This structured and transparent approach empowers organizations to recognize contributions equitably, enforce accountability, and leverage data for advanced lifecycle insights—all while maintaining the flexibility and scalability of GitOps principles.
